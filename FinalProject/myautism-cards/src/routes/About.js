        <p>This is an webiste that aims to help people with autism, parents and educators.

            I believe that all resources must to be free and must be availible to anybody who needs it.

            We will only build a better world, once we became better people. So the change starts from you.

            Feel free to share and use this tool. 

            I hope that in the future we will able to have more cards and material to share you with you.

            Thank you for being here and making the difference.
