        <strong>Peter Benjamin Parker</strong><br>
          <p> Is a high school dropout who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the superhero Spider-Man, hoping someday, he will live up to his heroes in the Avengers.<br>
             While Parker juggled all his continued hero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker then agreed and was given his new suit as well as brand new Stark technology in exchange for all his help, although Stark still did not make him an official member of the Avengers and instead returned Parker back home to continue his own hero work.<br>

            While he continued to try and prove himself as a worthy hero in the eyes of Iron Man so he could join the Avengers, Parker then encountered all the illegal activities of Vulture, who was attempting to sell his Chitauri based weapons onto the black market.
            <br> Believing that capturing Vulture would prove his worth as a hero, Spider-Man had decided to go after Vulture alone, with only Ned Leeds' assistance, while keeping all his secrets from Aunt May, gaining the affections of Liz Toomes, and also trying to win his decathlon finals. Eventually, Spider-Man had learned Vulture was Toomes' father and had then stopped his robbery of their Stark Cargo Plane, resulting in Stark offering Parker his place with the Avengers, which Parker turned down in order to continue being a small-time hero in New York.</p>
